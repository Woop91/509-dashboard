## 11. Understanding Hidden Sheet Architecture

### What Are Hidden Sheets?

The dashboard uses 5 "hidden" calculation sheets (prefixed with "_") to automatically synchronize data between sheets. You don't see these sheets, but they power the auto-updating columns.

### The 5 Hidden Sheets

| Hidden Sheet | What It Does |
|--------------|--------------|
| `_Grievance_Calc` | Calculates grievance data for Member Directory |
| `_Member_Lookup` | Looks up member data for Grievance Log |
| `_Steward_Contact_Calc` | Tracks steward contact data from Communications Log |
| `_Engagement_Calc` | Calculates engagement metrics from Meeting/Volunteer sheets |
| `_Steward_Workload_Calc` (v3.45) | Calculates steward workload metrics for Steward Workload sheet |

### Auto-Populated Columns

**Member Directory** (these columns update automatically):
| Columns | Data | Source |
|---------|------|--------|
| Q-T | Engagement (Last Virtual Mtg, Last In-Person, Open Rate, Vol Hours) | Meeting Attendance + Volunteer Hours |
| Y-AA | Steward Contact (Date, Who, Notes) | Communications Log |
| AB-AD | Grievance (Has Open?, Status, Deadline) | Grievance Log |
| AF-AH (v3.45) | Grievance Stats (Total Count, Win Rate, Last Date) | Grievance Log |

**Grievance Log** (these columns update automatically):
| Columns | Data | Source |
|---------|------|--------|
| C-D | Member Name (First, Last) | Member Directory |
| X-AA | Member Details (Email, Unit, Location, Steward) | Member Directory |

### How Auto-Sync Works

1. You edit a source sheet (e.g., change a member's email in Member Directory)
2. An automatic trigger fires (runs in the background)
3. The hidden sheet recalculates the values
4. The new values appear in the destination sheet

**⏱️ Updates happen within 2-3 seconds of your edit.**

### Verifying Hidden Sheets Work

**Step 1: Run Verification**
1. Click **Administrator** → **Setup & Triggers** → **🔍 Verify Hidden Sheets**
2. Review the report

**Good Result:**
```
✅ _Grievance_Calc: EXISTS, hidden, formulas present
✅ _Member_Lookup: EXISTS, hidden, formulas present
✅ _Steward_Contact_Calc: EXISTS, hidden, formulas present
✅ _Engagement_Calc: EXISTS, hidden, formulas present
✅ _Steward_Workload_Calc: EXISTS, hidden, formulas present
✅ All 5 triggers installed
```

### Troubleshooting: Columns Not Updating?

**Problem**: Member Directory columns AB-AD aren't updating when I change Grievance Log

**Solution**:
1. Run **Administrator** → **Setup & Triggers** → **🔍 Verify Hidden Sheets**
2. If it shows issues, run `REPAIR_DASHBOARD()` from Apps Script

**Problem**: Grievance Log columns C-D or X-AA are stale

**Solution**:
1. Run `REPAIR_DASHBOARD()` from Apps Script
2. This recreates all hidden sheets and reinstalls triggers

### Setting Up Engagement Tracking

If you want columns Q-T to auto-populate with engagement data:

**Step 1: Create Source Sheets**
1. Click **Administrator** → **Setup & Triggers** → **📅 Setup Engagement Tracking**
2. This creates:
   - 📅 Meeting Attendance sheet
   - 🤝 Volunteer Hours sheet
   - _Engagement_Calc hidden sheet
   - Auto-sync trigger

**Step 2: Enter Data in Source Sheets**

**Meeting Attendance** (enter each meeting):
| Column | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Date | 12/01/2025 |
| Type | Virtual / In-Person / Hybrid |
| Meeting Name | Monthly Chapter Meeting |
| Member ID | M000001 |
| Attended | Yes / No |

**Volunteer Hours** (enter each activity):
| Column | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Date | 12/01/2025 |
| Member ID | M000001 |
| Activity | Phone Banking |
| Hours | 3 |

**Step 3: Watch Auto-Population**
- After adding entries, Member Directory columns Q-T auto-update
- Q = Last Virtual Meeting date for that member
- R = Last In-Person Meeting date for that member
- T = Total Volunteer Hours for that member

### Repair Functions

If something goes wrong, use these repair functions:

| Function | What It Fixes |
|----------|---------------|
| `REPAIR_DASHBOARD()` | Recreates ALL hidden sheets + ALL triggers (the nuclear option) |
| `VERIFY_HIDDEN_SHEETS()` | Diagnoses what's broken without changing anything |
| `setupGrievanceCalcSheet()` | Repairs only the grievance → member sync |
| `setupMemberLookupSheet()` | Repairs only the member → grievance sync |
| `setupEngagementTracking()` | Creates engagement source sheets + hidden sheet |

**How to run these:**
1. Open **Extensions** → **Apps Script**
2. In the function dropdown, select the function name
3. Click **Run**
