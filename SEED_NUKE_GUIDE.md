# 🚨 Seed Nuke Feature - Exit Demo Mode

## Overview

The **Seed Nuke** feature allows you to remove all test/seeded data from your dashboard and transition from demo mode to production mode. This is a one-way operation that prepares your dashboard for real-world use with actual member and grievance data.

---

## ⚠️ What Does "Nuke Seed Data" Do?

When you execute the **Nuke Seed Data** function, the system will:

1. **Remove ALL Members**: Delete all test members from Member Directory
2. **Remove ALL Grievances**: Delete all test grievances from Grievance Log
3. **Clear Steward Workload**: Remove all test steward assignments
4. **Clear Config Demo Data**: Remove demo entries from Config tab:
   - Job Titles (Column A)
   - Office Locations (Column B)
   - Units (Column C)
   - Supervisors (Column F)
   - Managers (Column G)
   - Stewards (Column H)
   - Grievance Coordinators (Column O)
   - Home Towns (Column AF)
   - Office Addresses (Column AN)
5. **Preserve Organization Info**: Keep your real organization settings:
   - Organization Name, Local Number, Main Address, Phone
   - Union Parent, State/Region, Website
   - Main Fax, Toll Free numbers
   - All deadline and contract reference columns
6. **Preserve Structure**: Keep all headers, formulas, and sheet structure intact
7. **Show Setup Guide**: Display getting started instructions

## 🔄 Can I Undo the Nuke?

**No, the nuke is permanent.**

However, you can:
- **Restore from backup**: If you made a copy before nuking
- **Re-seed manually**: Run seed functions from script editor (for testing only)
- **Import data**: Add your real data to start fresh

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Dashboards Still Show Data

**Solution**:
- Go to `509 Tools > 📊 Data Management > Rebuild Dashboard`
- This recalculates all metrics

### Problem: Seed Menu Still Visible

**Solution**:
- Close and reopen the spreadsheet
- The menu is rebuilt on open

### Problem: Need to Re-Seed for Training

**Solution**:
1. Make a copy of the spreadsheet
2. In the Apps Script editor, run `resetNukeFlag()`
3. Run `seedAll()` from the menu

### Problem: Accidentally Nuked Too Soon

**Solution**:
- If you have a backup copy, restore from there
- If no backup, you'll need to import your data manually
- For future: Always make a backup first!

## 💡 Best Practices

### Before Nuking

1. **Make a backup copy**: File > Make a copy
2. **Document your needs**: List required config changes
3. **Prepare import data**: Have member/grievance CSVs ready
4. **Train your team**: Everyone understands the workflow

### After Nuking

1. **Start small**: Add a few test members first
2. **Verify calculations**: Check that auto-calculations work
3. **Test workflows**: Try the grievance workflow with test data
4. **Gradual rollout**: Add real data in batches
5. **Monitor performance**: Watch how dashboards update
